## repoorganizer
### __init__.py
Create a python script with a RepoCollection class. Set a global called ENABLE_SSH = true. At the beginning of the script, ensure "~/.config/repo-organizer" exists (always use expanduser when using ~ in a path). The constructor should set self.repos = None and self.name = None. It should have a set_name method that sets self.name. The class should have a load_repos(self, refresh=False) method that uses the GitHub API to list all repositories for github.com/{self.name}. The method can simply download all of the json then the json module to parse it, and set  self.repos to the result. If refresh is False the refresh_repos method should first set repo_cache = "~/.config/repo-organizer/{self.name}/repos.json" and see if repo_cache exists, and if so, load it with json.load and return from the method early. If there is any output, use the logging module for the entire program, using info, warning, or error as appropriate. For example, if refresh is False and the repo_cache file does not exist, log a warning "No, {repo_cache}, so downloading {url}". If the file is downloaded, set a local variable downloaded = True. At the end of the method, if downloaded is True, save the data to repo_path. The main function should be called under "if __name__ == "__main__" like sys.exit(main()) and main should return 0 if ok. The main function should set org_name = "traincontrolsystems", repos_path = None, then iterate through a list of possible folders: try_paths = [@"C:\Projects", "~/git", "~/GitHub", "~/Documents/GitHub"] using expanduser to see which one has a subfolder called "mirror-{org_name}", then set repos_path and break. if repos_path is still None, show an "No repos dir was found, so for safety nothing was done. Create mirror-{org_name} folder in one of the following first: {try_paths}" then return 1. Then the main function should create org = RepoCollection() and org.set_name(org_name) then call org.load_repos(repos_path). You must also create this load_repos method. The load_repos method should iterate self.repos. In each iteration, construct the repo clone URL normally, but if ENABLE_SSH then construct it like "git@github.com/{self.name}/{repo_name}.git" For each entry in self.repos, which is constructed as per the GitHub API call you would have made to make it, check if a folder with the name of the repo exists under repos_path. If not, clone the repo there. If does exists, pull. If any fail to pull or clone, append a line to "~/.config/repo-organizer/errors.log" like "failed to clone {url}" or "failed to clone {url}". For predictable determination of failures, create a log_error method that opens the file in 'a' mode each time. Ensure the loop continues in either error case. If the clone or mirror is successful, use a new method called log_success that operates similarly but appends to a file called  ~/.config/repo-organizer/repo-organizer.log where each appears like a shell command such as "cd {path} && git pull" or "git clone {url} {repos_path}/{self.name}/{repo_name}". Make the script python 2 compatible, converting all of my format code to use percent-sign substitutions instead, and at the top of the script but the shebang for python and then from __future__ import print_function

Move the logic of main to a gather_repos function that accepts org_name

instead of having a hard-coded value for org_name, eliminate traincontrolsystems literal and look for a list called "org_names" in os.path.join(config_dir, "settings.json") and iterate through, calling gather_repos using each list element as the argument. Use get('org_names') and if the result is None or empty list or not isinstance list, show a specific error for each settings problem.

First rename "org_names" to "orgs". Then change the loading process so the settings.json file requires orgs to be inside of another dict called "github" that is in another dict called "sources". If "sources" is missing from the root of the dict (parsed json), show an error, If "github" is not within "sources", show an error for that. Then continue the orgs checking, but check for it in this new settings structure (via settings['sources']['github'].get('orgs')) and only show an error if also settings['sources']['github'].get('users') is None, empty list, or not isinstance list. Require a boolean in the set_name method that sets self.is_org. The gather_repos call will also require an is_org argument and pass it along to set_name. Return the entire settings object from load_settings instead of only the orgs, then iterate for org_name in settings['sources']['github'].get('orgs') if not None and add True to the gather_repos call. Then iterate user_name in settings['sources']['github'].get('users') if not None, using False as the second argument to gather_repos. Check the boolean in load_repos and change the url so the "orgs/" part is omitted from the url in that case.
